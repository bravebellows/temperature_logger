The Dashboard page shows the last 10 temperature readings.

## Features
- Logs the temperature response from XW-110 periodically
- Shows the last 10 temperature readings

## Future Features
- Notifies the users when the temperature is outside the nominal range
- Notifies the users when the XW-110 thermometer isn't responding after a specified number of retries
